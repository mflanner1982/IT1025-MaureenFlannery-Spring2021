Internet Protocol
An IP Address is a unique number used to identify each device that is connected to the internet.  The original protocol called, IPv4, had a capacity for approximatel;y 4.3 billion devices.  Now, because of increased use of technology, IPv4 has reached its capacity.  Now, IPv6 exists, which is significantly larger and allows approximately 10 billion devices to communicate.   

ICANN (meaning Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is an organization that sets the standards & protocols for Internet activity worldwide.  The ICANN board of directors changed the policy for IPv6 addresses in 2006.
