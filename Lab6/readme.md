Executive Summary 

Internet Architecture

Internet Protocol
An IP Address is a unique number used to identify each device that is connected to the internet.  The original protocol called, IPv4, had a capacity for approximatel;y 4.3 billion devices.  Now, because of increased use of technology, IPv4 has reached its capacity.  Now, IPv6 exists, which is significantly larger and allows approximately 10 billion devices to communicate.   

ICANN (meaning Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is an organization that sets the standards & protocols for Internet activity worldwide.  The ICANN board of directors changed the policy for IPv6 addresses in 2006.

TCP/IP
The responsibility of TCP/IP is to define details of how packets travel through the internet.  It has standardized the way data is sent and received through the network.  

The client-server model applies to TCP/IP similar to a phone call.  A client is similar to a caller while a server is similar to a person receiving a call.   Like a phone call, information can travel both ways once the connection is established and information stops flowing once one person terminates the connection. 

Layers are important to changing technology because each layer of a stack performa a specific function.  They interact with the layer above and below itself.  This is similar to a post office in the idea that there is a person who sends the package, then there is the person who transfers it, and then there is the person who receives it.  The first and third person do not interact.  Using the 2nd person as an intermediary, the transition has layers. 

Internet Security

HTTP is hypertext transfer protocol and it is used for viewing web pages on the internet.  All information is sent across the internet in clear text, which makes it vulnerable to attacks.  HTTPS is a secured hypertext transfer protocol.  This means that it is encrypted data sent across the internet.  It can secure data in one of two ways.  The first way, HTTPS can use SSL, which stands for Secure Sockets Layer). It used a public key to encrypt data and communicates with a website after a website can confirm that they have obtained an SSL Certificate.  The second way, HTTPS can use TLS, which stands for Transport Layer Security.  It is based on the same ideology of SSL.  It uses an authorized server, client, and encrypted data. 

Securing Your Web Browser
You should secure your browser for a plethora of reasons. Any data that is hold on your device can easily be stolen, copied, and/or altered.  When a device is purchased, there is often software already installed on it.  Then, a user can add software as desired.  Also, most software requires updates.  With these three concepts, a device is left open to attacks.  In addition to this, some software can use a third-party's technology without a user knowing this.  In order to increase functionality, software often turns off some security features.  With these many vulnerabilities available, a user is left open to a trojen horse, worm, malware, etc.

Internet Programming
TimBerners-Lee is the creator of the world wide web and the leader of W3C.  He created W3C to create high-quality, unified standards across the internet. 
The standard of 'Web Design and Applications' is important because it unifies the technologies available to developers to make websites.  It makes the creation easier and the merging cleaner.  Also, it is very important for the purpose of accessibility to individuals with disabilities. 

HTML5 and CSS
The purpose of HTML5 technology is to create websites.  Is standardizes the language used for development.  
The purpose of CSS technology is to "control the layout of multiple web pages".  It helps to establish which website is the parent and which is the child within a site.  Also establishes, which websites are internal and external on a site.  
These two technologies makes it easier for developers to establish what each part of a website goes where, when, how, and why. 
When creating my webpage, the approach I took was simple, but diverse.  I didn't concern myself with the content of the page as much as the different tools that can be used to create the page.
