Hexadecimal Color Representation is a way to represent a number in red, green, & blue.  RBG Format (Red, Green, & Blue) is used to in with each color given a values 0-255.  Therefore, there is a total of 16,777,216 options.  

I imagine this system could be problematic when using a set of very similar colors or if the user is visually impaired.  Something like color-blindness or severe glaucoma could prohibit a user from appreciating this system.  On the other hand, if someone has something like cataract, the color code would probably be greatly appreciated.  (I personally have cataract and I color code almost everything at my job because I find it to be very helpful).  

*** Please note: I could not get the link to work, so I researched 'Hexadecimal Color Representation' on my own.
