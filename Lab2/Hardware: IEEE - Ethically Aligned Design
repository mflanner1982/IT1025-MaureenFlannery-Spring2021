Hardware: IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

The purpose of IEEE is to advance innovation while benefiting society.  It is an association meant to work with professionals who work in technology.  It started in 1884 in response to the telegraph, telephone, and electric light.  

The importance of ethics in device design is extremely important.  It affects privacy of the users, sales of the products in the company, biases of political opinions and many more aspects of our lives.  Although some people believe the responsibility of ethics in technology rests on the shoulders of developers, I firmly believe that it rests on the shoulders of the managers of the companies who produce the technology.  A developer works at the pleasure of their manager and they need to be able to work at a job where their expectations do NOT interfere with their ethics.  Unfortunately, that is not always possible.  Developers are often put into a position where they are forced to do things like 'spy' on customers or 'share information' if they want to keep their job.
