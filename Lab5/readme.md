Executive Summary

Lucidchart
My experience with Lucidchart was pleasant.  When I was in graduate school, we had to do several projects with Access.  I didn't have any resources like these websites to guide me. (They probably existed, but I didn't know I should look for them)  I only had a textbook and the teacher.  The teacher was TERRIBLE!  He refused to answer any questions (in class or during office hours).  He felt that graduate students should be able to teach themselves, which is a ridiculous theory!!!  In the end, my experience with flowcharts was so terrible that I have avoided them for years.  Now, using Lucidchart, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. 

Introduction to Networking

Data Transmission

Protocol          - 1. Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
Packet            - 2. Unit of data 
IP Address        - 3. Unique identifying number 
Packet Switching  - 4. Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
DNS               - 5. Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com


Network Hardware

Both the Hub and the Switch are internal (LAN) devices that connect to the ethernet with multiple portals.  But, the Switch is 'intelligent', which means that it learn IP addresses & save it.  With this data detected & saved, the Switch can send packets only to specific ports.  This increases security and reduces unnecessary traffic (bandwidth) on a network.  

There are several benefits to a Router over a Hub or a Switch.  First, a Router can reach other reach outside of the LAN.  A Router often has a Switch inside of it and it can connect to other Switches.  The Router can read IP addresses and, with this information, determine which packets to bring into its network towards its devices versus allowing some packets to move on undisturbed.  A router is a 'Gateway' to the internet.
