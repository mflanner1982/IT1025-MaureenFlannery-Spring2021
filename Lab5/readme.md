Executive Summary

Lucidchart
My experience with Lucidchart was pleasant.  When I was in graduate school, we had to do several projects with Access.  I didn't have any resources like these websites to guide me. (They probably existed, but I didn't know I should look for them)  I only had a textbook and the teacher.  The teacher was TERRIBLE!  He refused to answer any questions (in class or during office hours).  He felt that graduate students should be able to teach themselves, which is a ridiculous theory!!!  In the end, my experience with flowcharts was so terrible that I have avoided them for years.  Now, using Lucidchart, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. 

Introduction to Networking

Data Transmission

Protocol          - 1. Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
Packet            - 2. Unit of data 
IP Address        - 3. Unique identifying number 
Packet Switching  - 4. Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
DNS               - 5. Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com


Network Hardware

Both the Hub and the Switch are internal (LAN) devices that connect to the ethernet with multiple portals.  But, the Switch is 'intelligent', which means that it learn IP addresses & save it.  With this data detected & saved, the Switch can send packets only to specific ports.  This increases security and reduces unnecessary traffic (bandwidth) on a network.  

There are several benefits to a Router over a Hub or a Switch.  First, a Router can reach other reach outside of the LAN.  A Router often has a Switch inside of it and it can connect to other Switches.  The Router can read IP addresses and, with this information, determine which packets to bring into its network towards its devices versus allowing some packets to move on undisturbed.  A router is a 'Gateway' to the internet.

Network Topologies

A 'Single Point of Failure' is a an event where a computer or system of computers loses internet connection.  Generally, it is caused by a poor design with the internet distribution.  Star, Ring, and Bus topologies can all suffer from SPOF.  With a Star topology, the SPOF happens when the Hub or Switch fail.  With Ring or Bus topologies, an SPOF can happen if one or more computers in the system crash / are disconnected.  The Ring and Bus topologies have this built-in error because their design causes one computer to rely on the next. 

Infrastructure topology is very similar to Star topology, but it includes wired & wireless technology.  Wireless Mesh topology is similar to Mesh Topology, but it includes wireless capabilities.  I believe the Wireless Mesh Topology is the better system because it allows for wired & wireless connection while creating several redundancies for connection points. 

Network Design
The design for my network is simple.  The Internet comes from a tower to a modem.  From the modem, the internet travels to a router.  The router projects the internet to a cloud.  The cloud provides internet to the 2 PC's and the printer.  Then, the 2 PC's connect to the printer. 

NSA/CSS
The NSA's role in cybersecurity is pretty vast.  The NSA prevents drug smuggling, illegal immigration, attacks from terrorist groups, identity theft, and illegal commerce.  Because of the internet, these crimes of identity theft, sex trafficking, terrorist group communication have become increasingly easy.  The NSA's job is to try to intercept these communications and try to prevent or stop crimes from happening.
