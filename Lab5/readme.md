Executive Summary

Lucidchart
My experience with Lucidchart was pleasant.  When I was in graduate school, we had to do several projects with Access.  I didn't have any resources like these websites to guide me. (They probably existed, but I didn't know I should look for them)  I only had a textbook and the teacher.  The teacher was TERRIBLE!  He refused to answer any questions (in class or during office hours).  He felt that graduate students should be able to teach themselves, which is a ridiculous theory!!!  In the end, my experience with flowcharts was so terrible that I have avoided them for years.  Now, using Lucidchart, I was pleasantly surprised with the results.
