Executive Summary


PYTHON IDLE
The difference between the shell and the file editor in the IDLE is a command line tool that starts up with the Python Interpreter.  It handles simple, short programs.  File Editor handles larger, more-complex codes and uses highlighted text to guide the programmer.  

CODE EXAMPLES
Variable - a Variable is just a single value in Python.  It does not need to be defined.  It must be one word, only contain letters, numbers, and understores,        
    and it cannot begin with a number. It is similar to a 'box' for storage.  
    Spam, Bacon, and Eggs are common variables in Python because of a famous Monty Python Sketch. 
Assigned Statement - contains 3 items: (1) variable name, (2) assignment operator, & (3) value to be stored.  
    An example of this is: Maureen = 39. 
Function - a relationship between 2 or more variables
    An example of this is: 
      >>> food = 10
      >>> food
      10
      >>> uber = 10
      >>> food + uber 
      20
3 Data Types - the data for python can be a string, an integer, and floating-point number.
    An example of each (respectively) is:
      >>> str(Maureen)
      'Maureen'
      >>> int('39')
      39
      >>> float(39)
      39.0
