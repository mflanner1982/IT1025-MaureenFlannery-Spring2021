Executive Summary 

In general, this lab is to meant to learn & practic the fundamentals of Information Systems.  It taught some background on the development of computers. It defined the different components and their purposes. And, it taught the importance of small details within major projects. 

This lab also taught us how to establish a GitHub account to use for future development. 

Information Systems Components
1. Hardware - tangible pieces of the computer
2. Software - intangible pieces of the computer that make the hardware interact
3. Network communication - both hardware & software that give computers ability to interact with each other and users
4. People - 'Front-line users', customers, developers
5. Process - procedure defined by software for user to follow. 

An information System that I use every day is my smartphone.  I hold the hardware in my hand.  I upload / update the sotware in the system.  I use Wifi or a Tower to connect to the internet.  I interact with people through phone, text, & apps like facebook and GitHub. I know the process of my phone to use it appropriately because it has a very intuitive design.
 
When I Google "What is GitHub desktop?", this statement appears, "GitHub Desktop is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub from the desktop. With this new application, you can work easier without having to depend on your browser. GitHub Desktop supports: Attributing commits with collaborators. Checkout branches with pull requests."  To me, this means . . . very little.  I understand all of these words independently and I hear them often at my work.  But, because I have no experience with coding, I can't say that I completely appreciate their meaning.  I believe that the idea is for open-source learning / teaching.  

I believe GitHub is considered "Cloud Computing" because it provides mobile access and interaction with the site.  Although, GitHub stores data for the user, it also provides feedback to the User. Anywhere the user can access the internet, the user can also access GitHub, which makes it mobile. 

Another Cloud Computing Environment is Facebook.  It basically has the same concept as GitHub with user / website feedback and mobility.
