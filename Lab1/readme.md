Executive Summary 
In general, this lab is to meant to learn & practic the fundamentals of Information Systems.  It taught some background on the development of computers. It defined the different components and their purposes. And, it taught the importance of small details within major projects. 

This lab also taught us how to establish a GitHub account to use for future development. 

Information Systems Components
 
"Information Systems Components" - identify an information system that you use every day (gas pumps, store check-out, atm etc.  Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in this system. 
When I Google "What is GitHub desktop?", this statement appears, "GitHub Desktop is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub from the desktop. With this new application, you can work easier without having to depend on your browser. GitHub Desktop supports: Attributing commits with collaborators. Checkout branches with pull requests."  To me, this means . . . very little.  I understand all of these words independently and I hear them often at my work.  But, because I have no experience with coding, I can't say that I completely appreciate their meaning.  I believe that the idea is for open-source learning / teaching.  

I believe GitHub is considered "Cloud Computing" because it provides mobile access and interaction with the site.  Although, GitHub stores data for the user, it also provides feedback to the User. Anywhere the user can access the internet, the user can also access GitHub, which makes it mobile. 

Another Cloud Computing Environment is Facebook.  It basically has the same concept as GitHub with user / website feedback and mobility.
