Executive Summary 

Data, Information, and Knowledge

Data is raw facts with no context.  Information is data that has been processed, so it has a context.  Knowledge is the ability to understand the information. 

The primary key in the customers table would be the 'CustomerID' and orders table would be the 'TransactionID'.  The foreign key would be the TransactionID because it is unique to that customer and that order. The two tables would be related through the foreign key because it is the one thing that both tables have in common, but it is not repeated for any items in the table. 

It would be important for the type of data in a field to be defined because a cell can easily be altered or corrupted without a defined a type.  For example, in Excel, '05/06/2021' can become "May 06, 2021", "June 05, 2021", "0.00041234", or several other options.  In addition to the system storing the data incorrectly, it can corrupt a system when the data is transferred to another program.  

Big Data

The four 'Vs' of Big Data are Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Variability.  Volume refers to the size of the data.  Variety refers to the different types of data stored in a system.  Velocity refers to the speed at which the data is growing (or is processed).  Variability refers to the inconsistency of the data, such as when, how, and where the data is stored.  

Types of technology that have drive the increase for need of Big Data are NYSE, social media, and Jet engines. 

Structured Query Language

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.  It is the the basis for several database systems including SQL.  An RDBMS stores tables of data, called a DataBase.  

The first tables that I will choose are 'Customers' to 'Orders'. The 'Customers' table has 'CustomerID' as the Primary Key.  The 'Orders' table has 'OrderID' as the Primary Key.  The two tables share 'CustomerID' as the Foreign Key. 

The second tables that I will choose are 'Employees' to 'Orders'. The 'Employees' table has 'EmployeeID' as the Primary Key.  The 'Orders' table has 'OrderID' as the Primary Key.  The two tables share 'EmployeeID' as the Foreign Key. 

SQL Injections

SQL injections are malicious code in SQL statements.  The most simple way to reduce security threats to a Database is simply to limit access to the Database.  At my office, I use SQL everyday, but I only have permissions to view information in limited amounts.  Making sure that permissions, access, and data available to people (employee or not) should prohibit unwanted attacks.  

Ethical andLegal Implications

The purpose of a 'Code of Ethics' is to create a guideline for acceptable behaviors.  The ACM created a code for computing discipline because there are new ethical waters that have created questions with the development of technology. 

There are differences between a 'Code of Ethics' and an 'AUP'.  A code of ethics is voluntary.  Agreement to adhere to the rules has very little consequence except possibly being removed from a group.  An AUP is mandatory to agree to it before you can use any tools owned by an organization.  If you break the rules, your permissions to these tools can be revoked. 

I chose to read the Code of Conduct located on my employers intranet.  There is really nothing worth noting.  It is basically standard.  We are not allowed on inappropriate websites and should not be surfing the web all day.  Really, the code of conduct does not surprise me at all.
