File Compression

The purpose of File Compression is to preserve space.  It is a tool that can be used to to take multiple files and abbreviate them into one small folder.  This is useful for file tranmission because it is easier to email (or upload) one zipped folder instead of several files.  
Originally, 'svg graphic file' (a PNG file) was 722 KB.  I compressed the file (on a Mac) and it the zip folder that holds it is now 714 KB. If this had been a jpg file, it may have compressed to a smaller size, but it would not have been very much.
