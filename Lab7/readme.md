Executive Summary

In this lab, we learned the importance of using zip files, the different types of software development, and some important concepts in object oriented programming. 

File Compression

The purpose of File Compression is to preserve space.  It is a tool that can be used to to take multiple files and abbreviate them into one small folder.  This is useful for file tranmission because it is easier to email (or upload) one zipped folder instead of several files.  
Originally, 'svg graphic file' (a PNG file) was 722 KB.  I compressed the file (on a Mac) and it the zip folder that holds it is now 714 KB. If this had been a jpg file, it may have compressed to a smaller size, but it would not have been very much.  

Python OOP

The attribute of the Shark class is 'Shark' and 'Sammy'.  The methods of the Shark class are 'swim' and 'be_awesome'.  They are functions that are defined within a class. The purpose of a Constructor is to allow a programmer to initizialize attributes to an object.  It is automatically initialized, so the programmer does not need to call it explicitly. 

A Class is a 'blueprint for an object'.  It characterizes a set of objects.  An Object is an item within a Class.  It is 'manifested in the program'.  To 'Initiate an Object from a Class' means to set a definition to an object that is within a class. 

Object Oriented Concepts

The Instantiated objects of a class are any attributes that the class has defined to it.  For example, if a class existed for 'IT Department', the 'developers', 'testers', and 'business analysts' would all Objects that have the attribute of being an employee of the IT department.  

Inheritance in OOP is when a class is established and all of the objects within in have the class' attributes.  For example, there are 9 children in my family.  The Class is 'Nuclear Family' and the attribute of the group is that every items has the same last name (Flannery).  The Objects are 'boys' and 'girls'.  Again, these objects all share the same attribute, the last name 'Flannery'. 

Abstraction is the concept of showing essential information & hiding non-essential information.  Encapsulation is the concept of packaging data and functions together.
