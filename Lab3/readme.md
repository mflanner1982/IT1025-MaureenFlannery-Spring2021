Python

Pseudo-Code Nature of Python Pseudo-Code is more of a concept than an actual language. It is based on the idea of the message of the code rather than the text in which it is written. It's similar to explaining something in person to someone rather than writing formal instructions. So, the term 'pseudo-code nature of python' refers to the simplistic, intuitive form of coding. There is less concentration on the formalities (like punctuation) than the overrall message.

Interpreted Language vs. Compiled Language An interpreted language is one that requires a 'translation'. An example of an Interpreted language is Python because it needs to convert the language to be compiled before it can work with Binary on the hardware of the computer. A compiled language works directly with the system in which it is installed. An example of a compiled language is C++ because it works with Binary on the hardware of a computer.


Career Exploration

On the College Central website, I found several jobs for which I could apply.  I see that I need to better adjust my search because it is currently too vague.  Unfortunately, I am not yet ready to decide what I am looking for in a new job.  Because we are in a pandemic, I do not want to leave my current, stable job.  However, I do plan to move into development when the economy becomes more stable.  Ideally, I could stay at my current company because I have 5 years there already, but my current plan can easily change.
